## ðŸ’» Hello, World!
I'm Shynji Robbie Miyasato, and, sadly enough, this is my second GitHub page, as I've lost access to my first one early this year, lol.  

Anywho, I'm a computer enthusiast studying at one of the campus of the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Mato Grosso do Sul, best known as IFMS.

I'm currently working on the development of some command line interface applications besides the projects from my classes, both of which you can find in my repositories.

- [Current Repository](https://github.com/mira-oza?tab=repositories)
- [Old Repository](https://github.com/ap123b?tab=repositories)

Apart from school and development, I've got to say some about myself, as this is, y'know, my profile and all.

I like language learning, currently learning both English and Spanish, and, though I'm not really good at English, I still wish to study or work in the US sometime in the future.
